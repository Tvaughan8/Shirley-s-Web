		&nbsp; Mary entered the glorious room and instantly spotted John and Eric working among piles of colorful props. As she hurried toward them, a resting tiger lifted his head to watch her go by, and two doves that were standing on a table cooed at her.  When she stopped in front of John and smiled, he knew she had something important to tell him, so he stood up. Mary looked in his eyes and said, “I know who my new mother will be.”  
Big silver rings clang as John quickly put them down.  He wanted to know how Mary’s life was going to affect his, so he said, “Where is she?”
“She’s now living in New York.”
