		&nbsp; AS SOON AS THE ELEVATOR door opened, Ian and George rushed out. They nearly ran into a young couple who were waiting there. Ian started to apologize before running to catch up with George. As they went across the enclosed parking lot toward their personal vehicle, onlookers stopped short as they wondered why these two military men would be in such a rush.

George slowed down as he aimed his compact door opener toward one of the parked aeromobiles. He pushed the button and the doors of this small flying vehicle instantly slid upward revealing the two comfortable seats and intricate dashboard inside. They rushed in; then the doors of this vehicle slid back down.

“I wonder why they need us back on base now!” Ian shook his head while George hurried to get this machine moving. “Everything was fine when we left today.”

George instinctively entered the code to start this vehicle by pressing a series of numbered buttons near the steering handle. Then the headlights came on. “All I know is when my emergency alarm goes off, we had better get there now!”
